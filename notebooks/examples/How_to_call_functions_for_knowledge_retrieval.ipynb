    "# How to use functions with a knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on the concepts in the [argument generation](How_to_call_functions_with_chat_models.ipynb) notebook, by creating an agent with access to a knowledge base and two functions that it can call based on the user requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an agent that uses data from arXiv to answer questions about academic subjects. It has two functions at its disposal:\n",
    "- **get_articles**: A function that gets arXiv articles on a subject and summarizes them for the user with links.\n",
    "- **read_article_and_summarize**: This function takes one of the previously searched articles, reads it in its entirety and summarizes the core argument, evidence and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will get you comfortable with a multi-function workflow that can choose from multiple services, and where some of the data from the first function is persisted to be used by the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook takes you through the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search utilities:** Creating the two functions that access arXiv for answers.\n",
    "- **Configure Agent:** Building up the Agent behaviour that will assess the need for a function and, if one is required, call that function and present results back to the agent.\n",
    "- **arXiv conversation:** Put all of this together in live conversation.\n"

       " 'summary': \"Electronic properties of crystals can be manipulated using spatially periodic\\nmodulations. Long-wavelength, incommensurate modulations are of particular\\ninterest, exemplified recently by moir\\\\'e patterned van der Waals (vdW)\\nheterostructures. Bulk vdW superlattices hosting interfaces between clean 2D\\nlayers represent scalable bulk analogs of vdW heterostructures and present a\\ncomplementary venue to explore incommensurately modulated 2D states. Here we\\nreport the bulk vdW superlattice SrTa$_2$S$_5$ realizing an incommensurate 1D\\nmodulation of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) $H$-TaS$_2$ layers.\\nHigh-quality electronic transport in the $H$-TaS$_2$ layers, evidenced by\\nquantum oscillations, is made anisotropic by the modulation and shows\\ncommensurability oscillations akin to lithographically modulated 2D systems. We\\nalso find unconventional, clean-limit superconductivity (SC) in SrTa$_2$S$_5$\\nwith a pronounced suppression of interlayer coherence relative to intralayer\\ncoherence. Such a hierarchy can arise from pair-density wave (PDW) SC with\\nmismatched spatial arrangement in adjacent superconducting layers. Examining\\nthe in-plane magnetic field $H_{ab}$ dependence of interlayer critical current\\ndensity $J_c$, we find anisotropy with respect to $H_{ab}$ orientation: $J_c$\\nis maximized (minimized) when $H_{ab}$ is perpendicular (parallel) to the\\nstripes, consistent with 1D PDW SC. From diffraction we find the structural\\nmodulation is shifted between adjacent $H$-TaS$_2$ layers, suggesting\\nmismatched 1D PDW is seeded by the striped structure. With a high-mobility\\nFermi liquid in a coherently modulated structure, SrTa$_2$S$_5$ is a promising\\nhost for novel phenomena anticipated in clean, striped metals and\\nsuperconductors. More broadly, SrTa$_2$S$_5$ establishes bulk vdW superlattices\\nas macroscopic platforms to address long-standing predictions for modulated\\nelectronic phases.\",\n",

      "The academic paper discusses the trade-off between the expressive power and trainability of quantum neural networks (QNNs) in quantum machine learning. The authors propose a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit polynomial memory separations over classical neural networks in a classical sequence modeling task. The paper presents the contributions of constructing hierarchies of QNNs that achieve arbitrarily large polynomial expressivity separations over classical artificial neural networks. The authors also demonstrate that the introduced QNNs can perform the task in both continuous-variable and qubit settings. The results suggest that quantum machine learning may have practical advantages in classical sequence learning problems with long-time correlations. The paper also discusses the conditions and proofs related to strong submersion and expressivity separation in machine learning models. The authors acknowledge the need for further work to demonstrate the practicality of their approach and to explore connections with pseudo-telepathy games.\n"

       "- The paper discusses the trade-off between the expressive power and trainability of quantum neural networks (QNNs) in quantum machine learning.\n",
       "- The authors propose a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit polynomial memory separations over classical neural networks in a classical sequence modeling task.\n",
       "- The expressivity separation is attributed to quantum contextuality, suggesting practical advantages of quantum machine learning in classical sequence learning problems with long-time correlations.\n",

       "Evidence:\n",
       "- The paper presents the construction and implementation of hierarchies of QNNs that achieve arbitrarily large polynomial expressivity separations over classical artificial neural networks.\n",
       "- The introduced QNNs can perform the task in both continuous-variable and qubit settings.\n",
       "- The results provide memory lower-bounds for simulating the Clifford hierarchy and prove that quantum memory can store long-time correlations more efficiently than classical memory due to quantum contextuality.\n",

       "- The paper concludes that QNNs have exponentially more expressive power than classical machine learning models while still being efficiently trainable.\n",
       "- The introduced QNNs have practical advantages in classical sequence learning problems with long-time correlations.\n",
       "- Further work is needed to demonstrate the practicality of the approach and explore connections with pseudo-telepathy games."
