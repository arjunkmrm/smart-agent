# smart-agent
creating teams of smart agents capable of search and tool use, using custom search engine.

I know there are several pre-existing frameworks for this. However, I wanted to start from scratch so I could gain a finer understanding of agent systems and also to make this easily depolyable. Dependnencies are kept to be minimal wherever possible, and code as minimal. I'm using gemini pro's native function calling capability and building everything from there. 

End goal is an abstracted way to fleets of agent (similar to autogen and crew-ai). Currently, specifically tuned to gemini, however model-agnostic soon?
