## China - Market basics
10/11/2023

### What's specific about this market link

* **Direct account in SHCH** - upon approval from People’s Bank of China, we have opened an omnibus account at Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH), giving you access to the new asset class of Yulan bonds, i.e. newly issued bonds denominated in USD, EUR, offshore CNY, JPY and SGD. You can hold and settle these new Yulan bonds in your Euroclear Bank account
* **Internal settlement only** - at primary issuance, the complete position is credited to our account at SHCH upon green light from Lead manager allowing us to credit this position in the Syndicated New Issues Distribution Account of SHCH in Euroclear Bank. Against payment settlement takes place on Euroclear Bank books along the complete chain of instructed primary market transactions (provided that the instructions are matched, and there is sufficient cash and/or credit to allow settlement of the primary distribution trades). Therefore, primary market distribution (through the Syndicated New issues Distribution Account of SHCH in Euroclear Bank) and secondary market settlement both take place on the books of Euroclear Bank via internal settlement.
* **Disclosure requirement** - underlying investor reporting is provided to SHCH on a daily basis. This reporting may be used by SHCH to comply with People’s Bank of China’s regulatory reporting requirement and for meeting purposes. For more details, consult the [Disclosure requirements](https://my.euroclear.com/eb/en/reference/markets/china/china---disclosure-requirements.html) webpage.
