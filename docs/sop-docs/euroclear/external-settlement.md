19/09/2022

### What is an external settlement transaction?

A transaction between:  
* a Euroclear client
* a counterparty holding an account in a domestic market settlement system (directly, or via their domestic agent)

An external transaction settles:  
* via a link we set up with the domestic market
* in the domestic market CSD when we process the settlement confirmation from the local market

### Four types of links with domestic markets

* **direct link** – we have a direct account in the domestic market CSD through which transactions with local counterparties may settle

* **indirect link** - we have an account with a local sub-custodian that has an account with the CSD through which transactions with local counterparties may settle.

* **direct link managed by a domestic market agent** - we have an account directly with the domestic market CSD, but this account is operated on our behalf by a domestic market agent.

* **indirect link managed by domestic market agent -** we have an account with a a Depositary Agent
	+ Depositary Agent has an account with a local sub-custodian
	+ The local sub-custodian that has an account with the CSD through which transactions with local counterparties may settle
